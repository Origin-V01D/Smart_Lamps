from internet browser navigate to local IP of WLED device you wish to reset for example 192.168.0.xxx
can be found as attached device in router page usually 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1 

> from WLED main page > click "config" gear icon at top left > "Security and Updates" > click the tick box called "Factory Reset" this will
erase everything!

to backup and restore OV products, find the files on the google drive for your version (via serial number or software version)

or download locally and then navigate from WLED home page > click "config" gear icon at top left > "security and updates"

> there are two lines for "restore presets" and "restore configuration" you can click "choose file" navigate to correct JSON

JSON with _presets_ in the name is for effects that is uploaded to "Restore Presets"

JSON with _cfg_ in the name is for everything else, this includes all the essential led data to ensure your device works properly

equally you can backup any new config or presets via the two buttons "backup presets" and "backup config" for safe keeping and
restoring at a later date.
